Space X promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on their website at a price of $62 million, which is significantly lower than the costs offered by other providers, which can go as high as $165 million per launch. This cost advantage is mainly attributed to Space X's ability to reuse the initial rocket stage. Consequently, the ability to predict the successful landing of this first stage becomes crucial in estimating the overall launch cost. Such information can be invaluable for other companies looking to compete with Space X in securing rocket launch contracts. The project's primary objective is to establish a machine learning pipeline capable of forecasting the first stage's landing outcome.
